**Image Gallery**

[**Android App** ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ZoZb0Sq1W1PO270RByNruYxhsRQzNtn?usp=sharing)

App features:

 - Camera: Clicking on the Camera button opens the Camera.
 - Gallery: The pictures taken from the camera are shown on the app like
   an Image Gallery.
 - Modal: A click on a specific image on the list shows the image on a
   modal. The modal can be closed with a ‘X’ button at the top right or
   anywhere else on the screen besides the modal.
 - Pagination: The Image gallery can show 4 pictures at a time, so add a
   pagination at the bottom. The pagination should contain the number of
   pages available and ‘prev’ and ‘next’ buttons, if available.
 - Swipe to slide: User can swipe to slide to prev and next page.
 - Data Persistence: Persist the gallery image photos so the user can
   come back and continue with the same gallery of images.
